More changes for graphics mode:

- GPU palette cycling via GLSL! (Requires OpenGL 2.0 / ES 2.0)

- Add a dedicated method for destroying resources like textures, an FBO and
a shader program (or two, if palette cycling is in effect).
And that's it. No context/renderer destruction.

- Similarly add a method for creating the resources from scratch.
  * Should include the "preparegl" stuff as well.

- Add a method for creating a new window.
- Add a method for destroying window. ("Do almost nothing" in SDL 1.2?)

- When window is destroyed, also remove context/renderer/overlay.
- When window is created, maybe more than creating context/renderer/overlay.
  * For instance, detect GL version and pick GL function pointers.

- Handle uncontrolled window resize in... same way as now? (Simple)

- Chances are, at least in SDL 1.2 (probably also 2.0), that whenever we want
to destroy the SDL window, we should really shutdown the SDL video subsystem
and then re-init it.
(EDuke32: SDL GL attributes are set only for a newly created OpenGL window.)

- Another SDL 1.2 gotcha: SDL_GetVideoInfo should be called *before* any call
to SDL_SetVideoMode is done, say to obtain desktop dimensions.
So maybe it's another good reason for restarting the video subsystem, indeed.

- But out of all GL attributes relevant on SDL 1.2, it's only VSync which is
somewhat problematic. So, let's ignore it for now (as already done)...

- Add a dedicated method for setting video mode. What should it require:
  * Create window if there's none? (One of the methods above)
  * Otherwise manually resize the window. (SDL 2.0: Try un-maximizing first?)
  * Using methods from above, destroy and recreate resources (say textures).

- Similarly add a dedicated method for toggling fullscreen on/off
  * Simplest approach: Destroy everything (inc. window), recreate everything.
  * But do NOT call the "set video mode" method.
  * Just recreate window, context/renderer/overlay if required, and resources.

- When should the window be created, exactly?
  * In "set video mode" if there's no window, or fullscreen toggle.
  * Can be done on video subsystem init, but... also noticeable by the user.
