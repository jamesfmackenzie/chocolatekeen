Text parsing behavior (for files like STORYTXT.CK1, when just loaded)...

- First we count the characters in "di", until we encounter 1Ah.
Afterwards, "si" is used as a new counter.

Looping over "si", as long as we don't encounter 1Ah...
<jump to loc_1B3A4>
- Skip the current character if it's not 1Fh nor 0Dh.
- If it is 1Fh, *replace* it with 0Dh and continue.
Otherwise curr char is 0Dh and...
==> Compare the character number si+2 ("next next") to 0Dh.
- If *not* 0Dh, set character si to 20h. And then...
1. Push the difference di-si to stack.
2. Push the *offset*(?) of character si+1 to stack.
3. Push the *segment*(?) of char si+1 to stack.
4. Push the *offset*(?) of char si+2 to stack.
5. Push the *segment*(?) of char si+2 to stack.
6. Call "movedata" function.

==> Apparently, we want to *shift* text by one char.
We then decrease di by 1 (there is one character less now), but *keep* si as-is.
And continue the loop on si...

We still have one more case to check. Chars si and si+2 are both 0Dh.
If that's the case... check again hat char si is 0Dh
(it's done more than once...). If yes (now yes!) then we increase si *by two*,
and repeat. As long as we encounter 0Dh we do si += 2. Once we don't, we do...
si-- and then si++. So basically we can simply do nothing.
And then the original loop over si continues.
