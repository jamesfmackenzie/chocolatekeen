You have seen a short glimpse of the excitement that awaits in the rest of
the Commander Keen trilogy!

The second episode is "The Earth Explodes," which contains new features like
see-through windows, new aliens such as the Vorticon Elite, and truly
earth-shattering animation! Use moving platforms, evade new robots, and make 
your way to the Tantalus Ray chambers! Save the Earth before it's too late!

The third episode in Invasion of the Vorticons is "Keen Must Die!" In this
episode there is danger lurking everywhere as you visit Vorticon VI, where
you explore the richly-detailed Vorticon society. See beautiful parks,
dangerous cities, and confusing caves! And all this on the way to your final
confrontation with the Grand Intellect! Episode three features a big 
cast including Vorticon women, Meeps, Foobs, and VortiNinjas! And you 
won't believe the new, mysterious "Ankh" power! 


~     COMING SOON FROM ID SOFTWARE

As our follow-up to the Commander Keen trilogy, Id Software is working on
"The Fight for Justice": a completely new approach to fantasy gaming.  You
start not as a weakling with no food--you start as Quake, the strongest,
most dangerous person on the continent. You start off with a Hammer of 
Thunderbolts, a Ring of Regeneration, and a trans-dimensional artifact. Here 
the fun begins.  You fight for Justice, a secret organization devoted to 
vanquishing evil from the land! This is role-playing excitement.

And you don't chunk around the screen. "The Fight for Justice" contains fully
animated scrolling backgrounds. All the people you meet have their own
lives, personalities, and objectives. A 256-color VGA version
will be available (smooth scrolling 256-color screens--fancy that)!

And the depth of play will be intense. No more "whack whack here's some
gold." There will be interesting puzzles and decisions won't be "yes/no" but
complex correlations of people and events.

"The Fight for Justice" will be the finest PC game yet.
