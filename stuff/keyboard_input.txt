Keyboard input handling:

- For now, accept SDL keyboard events and translate the *keysyms* to DOS
scancodes. If an unrecognizable keysym is encountered, ignore it. That way we
can ensure vanilla behavior, with things like the loading screen being skipped
with ENTER and letters but not with the F1...F12 keys.
- In particular, for now we assume US English layout...
- Maybe we can rather look for the Unicode values if we want to accept some text
from the user (or even a single letter/digit). Problem is, when the user chooses
keys for the gameplay, we would need to know what to print. This can be a
problem.
- In particular we can't really tell the right keys to print here for the
current user configuration.
- So, just assume US layout again...
- At least, we would be able to use the very same CTLPANEL.CK1 file for now,
at least for keyboard support.
- Joystick support may come later; At least for a single joystick.
- Secondary support is less relevant today, and *maybe* the settings aren't
correctly saved for it in vanilla Keen anyway.

- Keypad keys: These seems to always work like NUMLOCK is toggled OFF.
- Text to print for specific keys (e.g. when configuring keys or typing a name):
Basically the vanilla Keen way using some internal table, apparently. There are
a couple of mentions of "QWERTY" (one is upper case, the other is not), with one
of them being relevant here, at least.
